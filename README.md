## How to get Game ID

Go to any game on Roblox.

Find the URL bar and find /games/

The next string of numbers will be the game ID.

e.g /games/18687417158/Forsaken/ \
The game ID for this would be 18687417158.


## How to get roblox cookie

Get a cookie editor or viewer I use [cookie-editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm).

Then go to roblox.com.

Log into the account or an alt account.

Open the extension and copy your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, the cookie starts past the warning so right after "items.|_".

**Do not give out your cookie randomly, it allows them access to your account.**
