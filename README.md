#How to get roblox cookie
Get a cookie editor or viewer I use (cookie-editor)[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm]
Then go to roblox.com
Log into the account or an alt account.
Open the extension and copy your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, the cookie starts past the warning so right after "items.|_".
**Do not give out your cookie randomly, it allows them access to your account.**
